Big O Notation:

Describes the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size 𝑛
n.

Common complexities:
𝑂(1)

O(1): Constant time.

𝑂(log 𝑛)

O(logn): Logarithmic time.

𝑂(𝑛)

O(n): Linear time.

𝑂(𝑛^2)

O(n^2): Quadratic time.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:

Linear Search:

Best: 

𝑂(1)
O(1) (Element found at the start).

Worst: 

𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) (Element not found or at the end).

Average: 

𝑂(𝑛/2)=𝑂(𝑛)

Binary Search:

Best: 

𝑂(1)
O(1) (Element at the middle).

Worst:

𝑂(log ⁡𝑛)
O(logn) (Element found after dividing the search range repeatedly).

Average:
 
𝑂(log 𝑛)
