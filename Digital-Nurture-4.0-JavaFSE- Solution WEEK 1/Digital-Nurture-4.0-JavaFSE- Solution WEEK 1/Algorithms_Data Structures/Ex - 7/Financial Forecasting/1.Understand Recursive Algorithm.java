/* Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

Advantages of Recursion:
Simplifies the code for problems that have repetitive, self-similar subproblems.

Makes it easier to solve problems like calculating factorial, Fibonacci series, or traversing tree structures.

Key Concepts in Recursion:
Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops.

Recursive Case: The logic where the function calls itself with a smaller input.

Example:

Calculating 
𝑛!n! (factorial of 𝑛.n):

𝑛!=𝑛×(𝑛−1)!
n!=n×(n−1)!

Base case: 

0!=10!=1 */
